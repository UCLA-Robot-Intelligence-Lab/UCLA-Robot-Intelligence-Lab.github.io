                        <p class="profile-description"> Yuchen is the founder of this Lab. Yuchen's research interest
                            lies
                            at the
                            intersection of machine learning, robotics, and human-robot interaction. Her work focuses on
                            developing algorithms, frameworks, and systems that facilitate efficient robot learning from
                            human interactions. Specifically, she investigates how to develop efficient learning
                            algorithms, harvest untapped data modalities, and design intuitive interfaces for
                            interactive
                            learning. Her ultimate goal is to democratize autonomation by making robots accessible to
                            everyday users.

                        <p class="profile-description">Tracey is passionate about the intersection of AI and robotics,
                            with a
                            particular focus on advancing intelligent systems. Her experience includes exploring
                            innovative applications of natural language processing (NLP) and retrieval-augmented
                            generation (RAG). She has also delved into computational robotics, developing skills in
                            formulating robotic systems and behaviors as mathematical problems for analysis and
                            optimization. These experiences inspire her to experiment with robotic arms, aiming to
                            integrate intelligent decision-making and control. Through this work, she seeks to bridge
                            theoretical foundations with practical implementations, driving progress in the synergy
                            between AI and robotics.
                            Aside from academics, she enjoys being outdoors, doing a mixture of sports, music, cooking
                            and
                            getting to know people :)
